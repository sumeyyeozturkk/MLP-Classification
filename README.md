# MLP Classifier From Scratch


Implement MLP(Multilayer Perceptrons) for classification.The number of hidden units 64 and the number of output units 10. Use cross-entropy loss for the classification task. Train your model with optdigits.tra for multiple epochs using stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches and test it with optdigits.tes at the end of the training. Plot a confusion matrix on the test data and report the test accuracy. Apply softmax function to the output layer to obtain class probabilities
